Attendance Management System
Overview
This repository contains the code for the backend of an Attendance Management System, developed as a capstone project during my Full Stack Development training at IBM. The system is designed to streamline the process of tracking and managing attendance for organizations. The backend is built using Java and Spring Boot, ensuring robust performance and scalability, with MongoDB as the database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Features
User Management: Manage user roles and permissions, including students, teachers, and administrators.
Attendance Tracking: Record and track attendance data for various classes and sessions.
Reporting: Generate attendance reports for analysis and review.
Notifications: Send notifications and alerts regarding attendance status and updates.
API Integration: Provides RESTful APIs for integration with frontend applications and other systems.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language used for the backend development.
Spring Boot: Framework used to create a stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based application.
MongoDB: NoSQL database used for data storage.
Maven: Build automation tool used for project management.
JUnit: Testing framework for unit tests.
